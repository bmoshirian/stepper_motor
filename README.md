# stepper_motor

Simple Stepper motor function with Accel Stepper and Arduino. 
Includes a really nice homing function when first initialising.
Remember to: 
1. First specify where to move with stepper.moveTo(X). Then use stepper.run() to move the stepper motor. 
2. CW is positive and CCW is negative.
